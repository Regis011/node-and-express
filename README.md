# Node, Express and MongoDB Starter
======
#### Simple install of projects.

`git clone git@github.com:Regis011/node-and-express.git`

`cd oden-company-overview`

`npm install`

**Configure database.**
Find the *`config-BACK.js`* file under the config folder and rename to the *`config.js`*. Then open the file in a text editor and replace ***DB_USER***, ***DB_USER_PASSWORD*** , ***DB_NAME*** and ***DB_URL*** value with your database log in value.
Database Schema is *`_id, name and course`*. To change this and enter your own schedule go to database.js file located under config map. In this file I only export a table from the database called *`"consults"`*. Change this to your own and if you will to get more data and tables just follow this structure.

To start project run
`npm start`

Enjoy!
